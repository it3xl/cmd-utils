
Insufficient Memory error
Attempting to XCOPY a source file that has a pathname longer than the Windows maximum path length
 (254 characters) will result in a rather unhelpful 'Insufficient Memory' error,
 the operation will then halt. 
This bug which has been around for over 10 years makes XCOPY a poor choice for any kind of backup script,
 use ROBOCOPY instead.

There are many sorces for this idea including https://ss64.com/nt/xcopy.html
